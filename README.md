# camp_yellow_intern_assignment

A new Flutter project.
This is an internship assignment for Camp Yellow for the role of Mobile Developer Intern Role (Flutter being the tech stack).
In this, the applicants had to clone (can have creative freedom) the given UI screens of a Clan discussion cum tournament app.
I really liked the whole process and would like to thank Camp Yellow for considering me for the aforementioned role.
I appreciate your time and thought in advance. I would greatly appreciate the chance to interview with you, and I hope to hear from you soon.
